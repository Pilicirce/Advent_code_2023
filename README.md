# Advent_code_2023

It is a challege for me: Advent Code 2023 exercises.  Every day of the advent calendar has two parts. Here I copy the link about what is it about:

It is solved with java
I am sure that there are more optimal ways to solve them. But I am learning and practising so it is the way that I solved them.

I upload the files with the inputs text for every day (ejercicioDia1.txt, ejercicioDia2.txt, etc)
